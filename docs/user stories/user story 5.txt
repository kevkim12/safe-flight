STORY 5: Allow the user to override whether they feel safe about traveling to a place.

As a user, I want the option to be shown the safety index (safe or not) before seeing flight information. This is because
I may forget or not even know that a specific country is unsafe. I may not have it in my saved places list.
As such, I want to be able to see its safety index and only if I override the safety index should I be able to see
flights headed to that country, as I may have a different feel of what is
dangerous (to me specifically or in general). Therefore, I can override the status if I feel strongly in the opposite
direction. This would occur if a place was deemed unsafe, I may be a person
that needs to go there despite the risk, and I canâ€™t be shown flights to that particular location unless I override the
status myself (to show I am aware of the risk).
