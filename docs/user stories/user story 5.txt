STORY 5: Email/app updates about location status updates

As a user, I want to be notified (through email or app) or notify others (if they are also using the app) when the status of a favorite location changes so I can change plans or flights ASAP if needed. I should also be able to see the reason why the change was made. This would be done by storing all user ids interested in a certain location under that locationâ€™s row in the locations database instead of searching through each user to see if they have that location as a preferred place. Notifying others would be through entering their email as someone to be notified, and should they have an account on the app, they would be able to receive a request to be notified about that location, and to decide whether to opt-in on email/app.
