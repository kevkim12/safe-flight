STORY 1: Creating an account / logging in through google oauth
As a user, I want to be able to create an account, so I can save preferred locations. This will be done using a google
account oauth. Assuming creating an account is successful, I should be able to store the countries I wish to
visit instead of searching for a country over and over (related to story 3).

Signing in/up through google oauth entails the creation of an account or logging in through google's system. No
information about the user's log in is stored except for a session ID token to ensure they stay logged in when navigating from
tab to tab.
