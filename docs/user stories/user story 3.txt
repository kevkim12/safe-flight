STORY 3: Saving location to favorites list

As a user, I want to save the places I want to visit because it would be unnecessary to keep searching for them each time there might be more news. These locations would be added in the user database under the corresponding user. Assuming this is successful, I would have a list of all the places I want to visit, and there would be a second column containing whether each place is safe or not, a third column would be a checkbox to indicate whether I have overridden its safety (or lack of). I should be able to clear the whole list at once if I wish to reset my favorite places, but I should also be able to delete a single location from my list.
