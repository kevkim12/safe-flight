STORY 3: Saving location to favorites list

As a user, I want to save the places I want to visit because it would be unnecessary to keep searching for them each
time there might a change in the travel advisory. These locations would be added in the user database under the
corresponding user. Assuming this is successful, I would have a list of all the places I want to visit, and there would
be a second column containing the risk factor. I should be able to clear the whole list at once if I wish to reset my
favorite places, but I should also be able to delete a single location from my list.

This would be implemented by using MongoDB to store the favourite countries taken from the database containing all countries
and their respective risk factors and displayed on a new tab called "Saved Places"
