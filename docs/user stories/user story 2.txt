STORY 2: Searching for a specific location & its info

As a user, I want to search for a specific location to see its safety information before I book a trip. I also want to know whether or not my friends or family are in a safe location. If friends/family members are in a place, I should be able to search about that place to get a sense on whether it is safe or not (without the need to search for flights for myself), and I can determine what safe means according to my definition (using keywords/articles connected to story 6).

Initially, a search on a place would be made, and utilizing both APIs, it would display either “safe” or “unsafe”. Upon requesting further details on why it was ranked as unsafe, I as the user would be able to see at most ten topmost articles from news API and five (if any) relevant flight dates. I would be able to do this to check on the locations of family and friends, but if I am looking for a flight myself, I would need to add a flight date range (after determining its safety either through processing api or manually overriding it on my end as the user, connected to story 2).
