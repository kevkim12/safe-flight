STORY 2: Searching for a specific location & its info

As a user, I want to search for a specific location to see its safety information.
This will allow me to also see whether or not my friends or family are in a safe location.
How this would happen is I would have a search bar to enter the name of a country, and I would be able to find the
safety index (safe or not).
