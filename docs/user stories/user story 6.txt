STORY 6: Display keywords found when determining a place is safe or not to allow the user to override whether they feel safe about traveling to a place.

As a user, I want the option to see what keywords and/or news articles are used to determine the safety status of a location because I may have a different feel of what is dangerous (to me specifically or in general). Therefore, I can override the status if I feel strongly in the opposite direction.
