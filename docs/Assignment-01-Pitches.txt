Project Pitches

We are using React for front-end and python flask for backend. Our database is stored using mongoDB.

Idea 1: Streaming & Theater availability (Available in region and streaming platform) (Secondary Idea)

Our first web application idea allows for users to search about movies and
TV shows (actors and what they played in) and get back information about the searched
item as well as what platform currently hosts it (Netflix, Hulu, and others). The driving point is that
streaming platforms display different content based on region, and our web application addresses that key issue.
Users will have the option to log on to the website using any social media platform account to fulfill our third
party authentication. The users will have their accounts connected to the web application for a reason, and that is
to store which region they currently are in, in order to display which streaming service hosts a particular movie/show
(accounting for region). Should a certain movie/show not be hosted in the region at all, we'll display the less relevant
(but still useful) detail of the different regions (and respective platforms) that do have the movie/show.
 The other feature we will be providing is that we display showtimes for movies currently playing in theaters,
 which is what Movieglu API is used for.

We will be using the "Watchmode" API, https://api.watchmode.com/, which is an api storing different shows and movies
based both on platform and region. We will be using MovieGlu API, https://developer.movieglu.com/ for different movie
showtimes (in theaters).



Idea 2: Safe Flight (Primary Idea)

Our second idea allows users to look up how safe a specific location is based on a safety index. The user will be able
to see if a country is safe to visit or not and store their favourite countries in a list that updates to check for
changes. This idea is to allow users to make informed decisions for their flight bookings.

The two APIS we are using are Travel Advisory (https://www.travel-advisory.info/data-api) to get the
latest travel advisory index on the countries and
Airlabs API (https://airlabs.co/docs/flights) will be used to utilize flight details such as airports and flight times.
